# LittleTinyStorage WebUI

This is a web interface for LittleTinyStorage.

</div>

## Features

- Get, upload, delete and rename files (across buckets!)
- Upload files
- Generate presigned URLs

## Setup

The easiest way to get started is downloading the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/dandanthedev/LittleTinyStorage/releases).

If you want to build it yourself, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. The web interface is now built in the `build` folder!

## Usage

Open the web interface in your browser. The interface should open.
It might ask for your LTS API key if it couldn't find it automagically.
